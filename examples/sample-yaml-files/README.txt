Sample cld.yaml files
=====================
This directory contains two sample cld.yaml files. You can use these as starting point
to build your cld.yaml files.

The yaml file provides the mechanism to provide all the inputs to FirstMile CLI
in a single place instead of using command line flags. In order to use this you
will need to put cld.yaml in your application's code directory.
